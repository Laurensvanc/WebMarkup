    <h2>Small assignment:</h2>
    <p>Going into a trip to London we managed to visit alot of places however getting a souvenire really brought the feeling home, 
        some would say that was too expensive but for what its worth <b>&#163;8,99</b> wasn't a bargan.
        We didn't stop at London however, we also went to New York and Paris, to sum it all up we brought some souvenires from both.
        In the end we made it to the price of <b>&#36;14,49</b> from New York and <b>&#128;11,99</b> from Paris.
